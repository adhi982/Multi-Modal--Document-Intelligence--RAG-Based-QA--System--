Fiscal and external surpluses softened mainly due to lower hydrocarbon prices. Banks are healthy but pockets of vulnerabilities remain. Reform momentum has strengthened, guided by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3). Outlook and risks: Near-term growth is expected to strengthen gradually. The medium- term outlook is more favorable, bolstered by massive LNG production expansion and reform gains. Fiscal policy: The authorities’ commitment to continued fiscal prudence is welcome. The positive outlook provides an opportunity to accelerate revenue diversification including to introduce a value-added tax and broaden the corporate income tax, enhance spending efficiency and gradually align domestic energy prices with export prices, and reorient spending to enable private sector-driven growth. Adopting a full-fledged medium-term fiscal framework, anchored by the benchmark to ensure intergenerational equity, will enhance fiscal sustainability while securing priority spending. Greater fiscal transparency and risk management, including on Public-Private Partnerships, will support the strategy. Monetary and financial sector policies: The currency peg continues to serve the country well. (Source: pages 5, 67, 77)",

      "answer": "Growth normalization after the 2022 FIFA World Cup continued with signs of activities strengthening more recently. Fiscal and external surpluses softened mainly due to lower hydrocarbon prices. Banks are healthy but pockets of vulnerabilities remain. Reform momentum has strengthened, guided by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3). Outlook and risks: Near-term growth is expected to strengthen gradually. The medium- term outlook is more favorable, bolstered by massive LNG production expansion and reform gains. Fiscal policy: The authorities’ commitment to continued fiscal prudence is welcome. The positive outlook provides an opportunity to accelerate revenue diversification including to introduce a value-added tax and broaden the corporate income tax, enhance spending efficiency and gradually align domestic energy prices with export prices, and reorient spending to enable private sector-driven growth. Adopting a full-fledged medium-term fiscal framework, anchored by the benchmark to ensure intergenerational equity, will enhance fiscal sustainability while securing priority spending. Greater fiscal transparency and risk management, including on Public-Private Partnerships, will support the strategy. Monetary and financial sector policies: The currency peg continues to serve the country well. (Source: pages 5, 53, 67)",
